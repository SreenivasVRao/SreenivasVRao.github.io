**Hello. :)**

I'm a 2nd year Masters student in the [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), at UMass Amherst. I love all things Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Erik Learned-Miller](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/) and [Huaizu Jiang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hzjiang/), primarily focusing on Self Supervised Learning.  

Before coming to UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies at [SSN College of Engineering](http://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai, and graduated with a BEng in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2017.

In the summer of 2018, I was an intern in the Interactions & Analytics Lab at [Xerox PARC](https://www.parc.com), working under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Shreve.](https://www.parc.com/about-parc/our-people/matthew-shreve/)
