**Hello. :)**

I'm currently an R&D Software Engineer at WeRide.ai in San Jose. I work on the Computer Vision team there, solving challenges in bringing autonomous taxis to the market!

Previously, I was a Masters student in the [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), at UMass Amherst. I worked with [Prof. Erik Learned-Miller](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/), [Prof. Liangliang Cao](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~llcao/) and [Huaizu Jiang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hzjiang/). I was mainly focused on Video Interpolation and Self Supervised Learning. 

In the summer of 2018, I was an intern in the Interactions & Analytics Lab at [PARC (previously Xerox PARC)](https://www.parc.com), working under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Shreve.](https://www.parc.com/about-parc/our-people/matthew-shreve/). I got to enjoy a brief summer researching problems in 3D computer vision, and augmented reality.

And even before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [SSN College of Engineering](http://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai, and graduated with a BEng in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2017.
