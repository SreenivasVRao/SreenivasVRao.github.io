#### Hello. :) 

I'm Sreenivas, a Masters student in the [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), at UMass Amherst. I love all things Computer Vision and Machine Learning. You might know me as the guy behind [that bot](http://reddit.com/u/riskyclickerbot) from [that website](http://reddit.com).

Before coming to UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies at [SSN College of Engineering](http://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai, and graduated with a BEng in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2017.
