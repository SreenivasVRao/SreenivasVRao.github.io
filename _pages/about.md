Hi, I'm Sreenivas.

I'm currently a Software Engineer in Amazon's Performance Advertising division in NYC. 

In 2019, I completed my Masters in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst.](https://cics.umass.edu) As part of the program, I did a capstone project on Video Interpolation and Self Supervised Learning from arbitrary frame synthesis, guided by [Prof. Erik Learned-Miller](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/), [Prof. Liangliang Cao](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~llcao/) and [Huaizu Jiang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hzjiang/).

In the summer of 2018, I interned in the Interactions & Analytics Lab at [PARC (previously Xerox PARC)](https://www.parc.com), working under [Dr. Matthew Shreve.](https://www.parc.com/about-parc/our-people/matthew-shreve/) I got to research problems in 3D computer vision, and augmented reality, eventually resulting in a [patent application.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200210680A1/en)

And long before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [SSN College of Engineering](http://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai, and graduated with a B. Eng. in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2017.


Currently, I'm fond of Emacs, mechanical keyboards, and Rocket League. :)
