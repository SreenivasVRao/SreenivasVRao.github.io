 S. Murali, R. Shrivatsan, **V. Sreenivas**, S. Vijjappu, S. J. Gladwin and R. Rajavel, <u><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7906791/">Smart walking cane for the visually challenged</a></u>,  2016 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC), Agra, 2016, pp. 1-4.
 
Research Projects
======
* Computer Vision Lab, UMass Amherst
	* <u>Camera Rotation Estimation</u> <br/>  Currently working under Professor <u><a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/">Erik Learned-Miller</a></u> on devising methods to estimate camera rotation from a sequence of images, and investigate improvements in motion segmentation.
	
*	UMass CS670 Computer Vision Course Project
	* <u>Depth Estimation from RGB Images</u>  <br/> Investigated supervised and unsupervised algorithms to estimate the depth of a 3D scene from a single image. Devised novel loss-functions, and evaluated performance of different CNN architectures on various datasets. 
	
*	UMass CS682 Deep Learning Course Project <br/>
	* <u>Learning Representations using Colorization as a Proxy Task</u><br/> Analyzed the effectiveness of self-supervised deep learning methods using auto-encoders, for the task of learning representations of images. Conceived and examined modifications to state of the art CNN architectures for image colorization. 

* Dept. of ECE, SSN College of Engineering, 
	* <u>Human Action Recognition from Videos </u> <br/> Worked under <u><a href= "http://www.ssn.edu.in/?page_id=1892"> Dr. N. Venkateswaran</a></u>, on identifying actions from videos, using CNN architectures. Designed a novel feature descriptor leveraging CNNs and classical Computer Vision approaches, and inspected performance. Gained exposure to video analysis, and popular frameworks like OpenCV, and Keras.
	
Work experience
======
* Summer 2017: Computer Vision Intern
  * <u><a href="https://e-Farmerce.com"> e-Farmerce</a> </u> <br/> I built a prototype system for identifying coconut farms from satellite imagery. Additionally, I implemented a system to extract images, label them manually, and train Deep Learning models on the data. In the process, I gained experience with Ruby, and deep learning frameworks. 

* Summer 2016: Computer Vision Intern
  * <u><a href="https://attentive.ai">Indria Labs (now AttentiveAI)</a></u> <br/>I explored different methods for abandoned object recognition from CCTV surveillance footage. I also built a dataset for luggage detection to train different Machine Learning algorithms. During this time, I gained exposure to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Online Learning, and Boosting algorithms. 
  
Extra-Curricular Activities
======
* President, <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/QFactorial/">Q! - Q Factorial, the Quiz Club of SSNCE</a></u> (2016-17) - Participated in, and organized several inter-collegiate quiz competitions, with competition from all over India.
* Chief Scriptwriter, <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LightsOutPlease/">Lights Out Please! - the Theater Group of SSNCE</a></u> (2016-17) - Adapted multiple English stories to stage, and won awards at the inter-collegiate level.


Fun Stuff
======
* <u><a href="https://github.com/sreenivasvrao/riskyclickerbot">RiskyClickerBot</a></u> - Content moderation system for Reddit, to detect harmful images and videos. 
* <u><a href="http://github.com/sreenivasvrao/cube-solver">Rubik's Cube Solver</a></u> - Python program to generate optimal solutions given photos of the Rubik's cube.
